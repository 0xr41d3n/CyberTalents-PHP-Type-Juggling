In  Big Number Challenge, we are required to enter a number that is no longer than four characters. 

and in the meantime needs to be more than 999, which might not be achievable without the use of certain mathematical methods

similar to exponential.

Since e is exponential, let's say we have a 5e3 number that is evaluated to 5000. 

In our code We evaluate only the value and not the data type when we use the == comparison operator instead of the identical operator ===

Thus, employing 2e4 will result  20000 because and it is a numeric number and greater than 999, which resolves our problem.
